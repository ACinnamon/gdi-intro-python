###What is programming?</h3>

* Teaching the computer to do a task
* A program is made of one or more files of code, each of which solve part of the overall task
* Programming code is human readable but also needs a form that the computer can run directly. This form is not human readable.
* To create the form of code the computer can use, we use the Python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a>. Other languages use other interpreters or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>
* Don't focus on what's "under the hood" for now. We will "drive the car" first
* In other words, there are many layers to the onion. We start at one layer and slowly move toward layers that are beneath or above us

###Command line, Python Shell, Text Editors</h3>

Program          | Description
-----------------|----------
**Terminal**     | A program that has a command line interface and issues commands to the operating system.
**Python Shell** | A command line program that runs inside of the terminal, takes Python code as input, interprets it, and prints out any results.
**Text Editor**  | A program that opens text files and allows the user to edit and save them. (Different than a word processor).
