        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Also known as "procedures"</p>
        <p> - A named unit of code that performs a specific task</p>
        <p class="fragment">When one uses a function, one makes a function <strong>call</strong></p>
        <p class="fragment">We have already made a function call when using the type, int, or float functions</p>

        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
a = '3'
print type(a)
a = float(a)
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Function calls</h3>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
a = 3
print type(a)
        </code></pre>
        <p class="fragment">A function can take <strong>arguments</strong></p>
        <p class="fragment">In the example above, the variable `a` is passed as an argument to the function `type`</p>
        <p class="fragment">Arguments can also be called <strong>parameters</strong></p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
# Some more function call examples

int('32')
str(32)
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Function definition</h3>
        <p>The following example is a <strong>function definition</strong>. This allows us to create our own functions</p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
def print_plus_5(x):
print x + 5
        </code></pre>
        <p class="fragment">The function definition has the following parts</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">The <strong>def</strong> keyword signifies we are defining a function</li>
            <li class="fragment">The name of the function being defined - `print_plus_5`</li>
            <li class="fragment">The arguments in parentheses - `x`</li>
            <li class="fragment">The function <strong>body</strong>, which is a block of indented code that executes when the function is called. - `print x + 5`</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Function returns</h3>
        <p>A function can also <strong>return</strong> a value</p>
        <p class="fragment">To do this, one uses the <strong>return</strong> keyword</p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
def plus_5(x):
return x + 5

y = plus_5(4)
        </code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">This allows us to call a function to obtain a value for later use. (Not the same as printing the value)</li>
            <li class="fragment">In this example, the function call `plus_5(4)` evaluates to 9, and y is set to this value</li>
            <li class="fragment">To determine what a function will return, use the <strong>substitution method</strong>.</li>
            <li class="fragment">If return is not used, the function returns <strong>None</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Functions with no arguments</h3>
        <p>A function does not have to take arguments, as in the following example:
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
def newline():
print ''

newline()
# prints an empty line. Nothing is returned
        </code></pre>
        <p class="fragment">This is useful when the function does some work but doesn't need any parameters. i.e. The function is intended to always do the same thing</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Functions with more than one argument</h3>
        <p>A function can also take more than one argument separated by commas. For example:</p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
def find_rectangle_area(width, height):
return width * height

area = find_rectangle_area(3, 4)
# area is set to the value 12
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The <strong>scope</strong> of a variable is the area of code in which a variable is still valid and can be used.</p>
        <p class="fragment">Variables defined within a function can not be used elsewhere.</p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
def get_triangle_area(base, height):
rect_area = base * height
return rect_area / 2.0

triangle_area = get_triangle_area(10, 20)

print height
# NameError
print rect_area
# NameError
        </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Import statements</h3>
        <p>The <strong>import</strong> statement allows us to use Python code that is defined in one file in a different file, or inside of the shell.</p>
        <p class="fragment">The <strong>from</strong> keyword allows us to only import parts of a Python file</p>
        <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment python">
# In knights.py
def shrubbery():
print "I am a shrubber"

def ni():
print "Ni!" * 3

# Run a Python shell in the same directory as knights.py and enter the following
import knights
knights.shrubbery()
knights.ni()

# or
from knights import shrubbery, ni
shrubbery()
ni()

        <h3>Let's Develop It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a program that uses at least one function to solve a geometry problem</li>
            <li>Hint: You might use a loop that obtains user input, does the calculation, then prints the answer. As before, the user should be able to quit by entering "quit"</li>
            <li>Hint: You can import your function in the shell and call it with different parameters to test it out</li>
            <li>Hint: Download <a href="http://calebsmith.github.io/gdi-intro-python/examples/geometry.py">geometry.py</a> and use it as an example</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you'd like to try something different or in addition, try the next slide...</p>

        <h3>Let's Develop It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between a given range, such as 1 to 10</li>
            <li>The program should give the user hints such as "too high" or "too low". Alternatively, the hints might be "warm" or "cold" depending on how close they are to the number</li>
            <li>The computer will need to have a random number for the user to guess:</li>
            <pre><code contenteditable class="python">
#At the top of the file
from random import randint

# Use this line where you need to have a random number.
# (Hint, this is probably used before the user input loop)
random_number = randint(1, 10)
