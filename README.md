The slides for this course can be viewed [here](http://calebsmith.github.io/gdi-intro-python/#/)

This is the Girl Develop It RDU Intro to Python course. Material is loosely based on Think Python by Allen B. Downey and written by Caleb Smith

The course is divided into 4 sections. Each of the slides and practice files can be customized according to the needs of a given class or audience.


Development Setup
-----------------

To work on these slides, follow these steps:

* Fork the repo and clone it to a local working directory.
* Clone the reveal git submodule.
* For a livereload server, `pip install -r requirements`. (If you don't have a
full Python environment, there are various other livereload server
implementations such as those in Ruby or Node.js)
* Install the livereload chrome extension.
* Run the server.py server in a terminal using `python server.py` and open a
browser to localhost at the port of the server (defaults to 8000)
